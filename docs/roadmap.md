# cam-flow Strategic Roadmap

This is the definitive document for where cam-flow is going and why.
It reflects the CLI and CAM phase work already shipped, the critical
gaps identified against real workflow demands (calculator demo, RTL
hardware verification), and a deep investigation of Hermes Agent
(Nous Research) to decide what patterns to adopt and what to skip.

---

## 1. Current State

### 1.1 CLI Phase — DONE (validated 2026-04-05)

- YAML DSL with 4 node types: `cmd`, `agent`, `skill`, `subagent`
- One-step-per-tick execution via `/workflow-run` skill driven by `/loop`
- State persists to `.claude/state/workflow.json`
- Trace persists to `.claude/state/trace.log` (JSONL)
- Template substitution: `{{state.xxx}}` resolved per tick
- Calculator demo: 4 bugs fixed in 4 loops, all 11 tests pass
- Experiments proving skill invocation, subagent isolation, and lessons flow

Reference: `docs/cam-phase-plan.md §0`, `camflow-handoff/docs/camflow-cli-research-handoff.md`.

### 1.2 CAM Phase engine — DONE (2026-04-18, 116 tests, pushed)

Each node runs as a separate camc agent (or direct subprocess for `cmd`).
The engine is a persistent Python process that owns the state machine.

Shipped modules (`src/camflow/backend/cam/`):

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `engine.py` | `Engine` class + `EngineConfig`; signal handlers; retry loop with error classification and context-aware retry prompts; orphan recovery on resume; workflow + per-node timeouts; loop detection; dry-run; progress reporting |
| `agent_runner.py` | Dual-signal polling (file-first, camc status second); split into `start_agent` / `finalize_agent` so `current_agent_id` can be persisted between start and wait |
| `cmd_runner.py` | Captures stdout (2000c) and stderr (500c) tails; promotes to `state.last_cmd_output` / `state.last_cmd_stderr` |
| `prompt_builder.py` | Injects `state.lessons` and `state.last_failure` into prompts; `build_retry_prompt` with RETRY banner |
| `orphan_handler.py` | `decide_orphan_action` (no_orphan / wait / adopt_result / treat_as_crash) |
| `tracer.py` | `build_trace_entry` with replay-format fields (ts_start, ts_end, duration_ms, input_state, output_state, agent_id, exec_mode, completion_signal, lesson_added, event); deep-copies snapshots |
| `progress.py` | Stdout progress line + `.camflow/progress.json` |
| `result_reader.py` | Reads and validates `.camflow/node-result.json`; synthesizes fail result on missing / malformed / incomplete |

Shipped support modules:

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `src/camflow/backend/persistence.py` | `save_state_atomic` (temp + rename + fsync + dir fsync); `append_trace_atomic`; `load_trace` skips malformed trailing lines |
| `src/camflow/engine/error_classifier.py` | `retry_mode(error)` → `transient` / `task` / `none` |
| `src/camflow/engine/memory.py` | `add_lesson_deduped` with exact-string dedup + FIFO prune (max 10) |
| `src/camflow/engine/transition.py` | `if: success` shortcut wired; cmd nodes get `{{state.x}}` substitution |

### 1.3 Hermes investigation — DONE

7 reports, full installation, strategic recommendation. Bottom line:
**cherry-pick 4 patterns (~200 lines), do not migrate**. See §6.

---

## 2. Critical Gaps (MUST fix)

These block real workflows today. Ordered by severity.

### 2.1 Agent reuse within loops

**Problem.** The engine creates a fresh camc agent per node execution.
A `fix → test → fix` loop currently spawns N agents, each starting
from zero context. The second `fix` agent has no memory of what the
first agent tried — the only channel is `state.last_failure`, which
is a short text summary, not the working knowledge the agent built up
during its 12K+ tokens of analysis.

**Fix.** Keep an agent alive within a loop. Send follow-up tasks via
`camc send <id>` instead of spawning a new agent. Destroy only when
the workflow exits the loop (or on explicit boundary).

**Implementation sketch.**
- Add `reuse_scope` to node DSL: `loop` (default), `node`, `workflow`
- In `engine.py::_run_node`: if an agent for this loop scope is alive,
  `camc send` the new prompt and wait for the next `node-result.json`
- On loop exit (transition to a node outside the loop), `camc stop`
- Track live agents in `state.active_agents[scope_key] = agent_id`

**Why this matters.** Token economy: each fresh agent is ~12K tokens
of bootstrap. A 10-iteration loop is 120K tokens of waste. With reuse,
it's one bootstrap plus incremental turns.

### 2.2 camc session ID tracking

**Problem.** On reboot/resume, camc searches agents by working
directory path. Multiple agents at `/home/hren` collide. We hit this
bug 3 times in production (agents `l1tcm`, `eab4f56e`, `camflow`).
Wrong session gets adopted; the orphan handler in cam-flow can't save
us if camc itself is confused about identity.

**Fix.** Store `session_id` (the tmux session name, e.g.
`cam-486ffaeb`) in `agents.json`. On resume, adopt by `session_id`
directly, not by path match.

**Scope.** This is a camc fix, not a cam-flow fix, but cam-flow's
orphan handling depends on it. Track as a blocker on camc team.

**Files touched (camc):** `~/bin/camc` adoption logic, `~/.cam/agents.json` schema.

### 2.3 Structured state schema

**Problem.** `state.error`, `state.last_cmd_output`, and other fields
are free-form strings. Each node has to parse them back into meaning.
The agent has no predictable structure to rely on when it reads
injected context.

**Fix.** Adopt the Hermes six-section template as the canonical state
shape carried between nodes:

```json
{
  "active_task": "Fix the divide() zero-check bug",
  "completed_actions": ["Analyzed 4 failing tests", "Identified root cause in divide()"],
  "active_state": {"last_test_run": "3 passed, 1 failed"},
  "blocked": [],
  "resolved": ["average() empty-list check"],
  "next_steps": ["Fix divide()", "Run test suite"]
}
```

The engine rolls each node's result into this structure. Agents see
the same schema every time.

**Implementation.** New module `src/camflow/engine/compaction.py`
with:
- `SixSectionState` dataclass
- `roll_forward(state, result)` — merges a node result into the structure
- `render_for_prompt(state)` — returns the block to inject into prompts

`prompt_builder.py` emits it via a new template section. `state.json`
gains a `compact` key that mirrors this structure.

### 2.4 Fenced recall framing

**Problem.** Agents read `{{state.last_failure.summary}}` as if it
were new instructions. The content is historical, but the agent
doesn't know that without explicit framing. Result: agents re-do
completed work, or get confused about what's asked vs. what's context.

**Fix.** Wrap all `{{state.*}}` injections with a "recall fence":

```
<recall type="informational-background">
  <!-- everything from state goes here -->
  <!-- This is what has happened so far. It is NOT a new instruction. -->
  <!-- Your task is below, after this block. -->
</recall>
```

**Implementation.** 3-line addition to
`src/camflow/backend/cam/prompt_builder.py`:
- `_context_block` → wrap output in the fence
- Add contract-level note after the fence: "The above is context.
  Your task follows."

### 2.5 Test program hex generation for RTL workflows

**Problem.** cam-flow v0.1 targets software development. The RV32IMC
hardware verification test revealed a class of workflows we don't
support: generate a test program → compile to hex → run simulation →
analyze waveform.

**Fix.** This isn't one feature — it's a category that needs:
- A richer `cmd` type that captures artifact paths (not just stdout)
- An `artifact` reference resolver so `with: run this against
  @artifact://generated.hex` works
- Workflow examples for the RTL domain

**Implementation.**
- `spec/artifact-ref.md` — define the `@artifact://` reference syntax
- `engine/artifact_ref.py` — resolve `@artifact://path` to file contents or path
- `examples/rtl-verify/` — reference workflow for RV32IMC style cases

Deferred to month 2 because the work is larger and our users are
mostly software for now.

## 3. Exception Handler (high priority)

Inspired by the PUA project (github.com/tanweai/pua, 16k stars) but
with proper engineering instead of gimmicky "pressure" rhetoric. PUA
demonstrated that structured methodology selection, graduated failure
response, and context preservation across compaction measurably
improve task completion. We adopt the engineering, drop the theatrics.

Three components, all in `src/camflow/engine/`, wired into the CAM
engine main loop.

### 3.1 Methodology Router

**Problem.** The same generic "retry with more context" prompt goes
to debug tasks, build tasks, research tasks, and architecture tasks
alike. Each of these benefits from a different problem-solving
strategy; picking the right one up front cuts iterations.

**Fix.** Auto-select a methodology by inspecting the node's `do` field
(and optionally its `with` hints), then inject the matching procedure
into the agent's prompt.

| Node category (detected from `do`) | Methodology injected |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| debug / fix / repair | **RCA** — reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → verify |
| build / compile / package | **Simplify-first** — question assumptions, remove unnecessary, simplify, accelerate |
| research / analyze / investigate | **Search-first** — find prior art, compare approaches, synthesize |
| architecture / design / refactor | **Working-backwards** — define outcome, identify constraints, design, validate |
| test / verify / validate | **Systematic coverage** — enumerate cases, prioritize edge cases, prove/disprove |

Detection is keyword-based on the node name and `do` field. Unknown
node types get a neutral fallback (no methodology injection).

**Files (new).**
- `src/camflow/engine/methodology_router.py` — `detect_category(node)` and `methodology_for(category)`
- `src/camflow/backend/cam/prompt_builder.py` — new `_methodology_block(node)` call, placed just above the task section
- `tests/unit/test_methodology_router.py` — category detection + fallback

**Acceptance.** For each category, a representative node name routes
to the expected methodology. A node like `start` with `do: agent claude`
and no keyword match gets no injection (neutral fallback, verified by
test).

### 3.2 Failure Escalation Ladder

**Problem.** After `max_retries` attempts with context-aware retry
prompts, the engine gives up. But real debugging sometimes needs a
qualitative shift in strategy — not just another retry. Today's retry
loop is flat; we need graduated response levels.

**Fix.** Track an escalation level per node in state, incrementing on
each failure. Each level applies a different intervention:

| Level | Name | Intervention |
|------:|------|------|
| L0 | Normal | Standard retry with context from previous failure (current behavior) |
| L1 | Rethink | Force a fundamentally different approach. Banner: "your previous approach failed, try a completely different strategy — do NOT re-apply the prior fix" |
| L2 | Deep Dive | Require source code reading + 3 distinct hypotheses written down BEFORE any fix attempt; reject the result if the fix-first pattern is detected |
| L3 | Diagnostic | Activate the full checklist: read all related files, check dependencies, verify environment assumptions, inspect relevant logs, dump state |
| L4 | Escalate | Flag for human review. Save full diagnostic state under `.camflow/escalation/<node>-<ts>.json`. Optionally send notification via a messaging skill (Teams, email). Workflow enters `waiting` status until manual `resume` |

**Semantics.**
- Escalation level is per-node: `state.escalation[node_id] = L0..L4`
- Reset to L0 when the node succeeds OR when workflow pc moves to a
  different node
- Level advances by one on each consecutive failure at that node
- Max-retries still applies within a level; transitioning through all
  levels without success ends in L4 (escalate)

**Files (new).**
- `src/camflow/engine/escalation.py` — `class Escalation` with
  `level_for(node_id, state)`, `advance(node_id, state)`,
  `reset(node_id, state)`, and `banner_for(level)` (returns the
  prompt-prefix string for that level)
- `src/camflow/backend/cam/engine.py` — wire into the retry branch of
  `_apply_result_and_transition`: after incrementing `retry_counts`,
  call `Escalation.advance`; pass the level to `build_retry_prompt` so
  the banner and procedure change with the level
- `src/camflow/backend/cam/prompt_builder.py` — `build_retry_prompt`
  gains an `escalation_level` parameter that selects the right banner
- `tests/unit/test_escalation.py` — level progression, reset on
  success, reset on node change, max-level behavior

**Acceptance.** A node that fails 4 times produces 4 prompts with
levels L1, L2, L3, L4 in order (L0 was the initial attempt). On the
5th call (still failing), workflow enters `waiting` with a diagnostic
bundle written to `.camflow/escalation/<node>-<ts>.json`.

### 3.3 PreCompact State Preservation

**Problem.** Long-running agent nodes can fill the Claude Code context
window and trigger auto-compaction. When compaction happens, critical
debugging state can be summarized away: the failure count, the
current hypothesis, the set of files already tried. The agent
effectively starts over mid-task.

**Fix.** Detect compaction (via a Claude Code hook, or via size
monitoring as a fallback). Immediately before compaction, preserve a
structured preamble and re-inject it into the compacted context so
the agent keeps its debugging state.

Preserved fields:
- `failure_count` — consecutive failures at this node
- `escalation_level` — current L0..L4
- `current_hypothesis` — last stated hypothesis (from result.summary)
- `files_touched` — list of paths read or modified this node
- `test_results_summary` — last pass/fail counts
- `key_observations` — short bullets the agent flagged as important

**Files (new).**
- `src/camflow/engine/compact_guard.py` — `snapshot(state, node_id)`
  and `build_preamble(snapshot)`; writes to
  `.camflow/precompact/<node>.json`
- Claude Code hook (installed by the engine on first agent run)
  detects `PreCompact` events and calls into the guard
- `src/camflow/backend/cam/prompt_builder.py` — on retry, read the
  latest preamble for the node and prepend it to the prompt
- `tests/unit/test_compact_guard.py` — snapshot/preamble round-trip;
  missing-hook fallback path

**Acceptance.** Simulate compaction during a multi-turn agent run.
Post-compaction, the agent's next prompt contains the structured
preamble (hypothesis, escalation level, files touched). Agent behavior
matches the pre-compaction trajectory rather than restarting.

### 3.4 Rationale

Three things, none of them "AI pressure":
- **Right tool for the job.** Methodology routing picks a debugging
  strategy that matches the problem shape, not a one-size prompt.
- **Graduated response.** Repeated failure doesn't get the same prompt
  louder — it gets a different strategy, and eventually human review.
- **State preservation.** Long tasks keep their working state across
  context compaction instead of silently losing it.

## 4. Should-Have (high value)

### 4.1 Skill evolution Phase 1 — trace rollup + measurement

**Problem.** GEPA's pitch is "40% faster self-evolving skills". In
practice GEPA is an offline tool that costs $2–10/run and doesn't ship
with Hermes runtime. cam-flow has better raw material: every node's
pass/fail is recorded in `trace.log` with typed errors and durations.
We can build trace-driven evolution that's actually online.

**Plan (Phase 1).** New CLI: `cam evolve report`.
- Reads all `trace.log` files under a project (or a time range)
- Aggregates per-skill statistics: total runs, pass rate, mean
  duration, top failure categories, retry frequency
- Output: `~/.cam/evolve/report.json` + an ASCII dashboard
- No mutation — measurement only. Phases 2+ add targeted mutations.

**Files (new).**
- `src/camflow/evolve/__init__.py`
- `src/camflow/evolve/rollup.py` — aggregates traces
- `src/camflow/evolve/report.py` — produces report.json
- `src/camflow/evolve/cli.py` — `cam evolve report` entry point

### 4.2 Port 3 hermes-CCC core skills

The Hermes "core-brain" skills are pure markdown with a rigid schema
(Purpose / Activation / Procedure / Decision rules / Output contract /
Failure modes). Directly portable.

| Port | Target location | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `hermes-route` | `~/.claude/skills/cam-route/SKILL.md` | Task triage: given a user ask, decide which skill/workflow to run |
| `systematic-debugging` | `~/.claude/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` | 10-phase debug procedure (reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → test → fix → verify) |
| `subagent-driven-development` | `~/.claude/skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` | Decomposition: split a task into subagent-sized chunks |

Each port: copy, rename references from `hermes-*` to `cam-*`, adapt
examples to cam-flow workflow context.

### 4.3 Iteration budget with cmd-refund

**Problem.** A runaway workflow can spawn unlimited agents. Current
guard is `max_node_executions` (loop detection), but that counts all
execution types equally. `cmd` nodes are cheap (no LLM) and shouldn't
consume the same budget as `agent` nodes.

**Fix.** Two budgets:
- `max_agent_iterations` (default 20) — counts only `agent` / `subagent` / `skill` nodes
- `max_node_executions` (default 50) — counts all, loop-detection guard

Enforced in `engine.py::_execute_step` before dispatch.

### 4.4 Dry-run mode polish

Dry-run exists but is minimal — static walk of the happy path.
Enhance to:
- Show both happy and `if fail` reachability
- Report unreachable nodes
- Show max agent iterations estimate
- Report unresolved `{{state.*}}` references

**File:** `src/camflow/backend/cam/engine.py::Engine.dry_run`.

## 5. Nice-to-Have (future)

| # | Feature | Target phase |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 10 | Parallel node execution | Month 3+ |
| 11 | SDK Phase (direct Anthropic API, no camc) | Month 3+ |
| 12 | Skill evolution Phase 3–4 (automated mutation + A/B testing) | Month 3+ |
| 13 | Hermes as a cam adapter — `cam run hermes "task"` invokes Hermes as a sub-runtime | Month 3+ |
| 14 | Webhook event ingress for external triggers (spec exists in `src/camflow/spec/webhook.md`; not implemented) | Month 3+ |

---

## 6. Hermes Comparison (team reference)

Investigation summary. Compare honestly so the team understands what
each tool is actually good at.

### 6.1 Marketing vs reality

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Auto-creates skills every 15 tool calls" | Trigger is 5+ calls, not 15. No config flag. Quality unreliable — agent can't self-assess accurately. Can overwrite manually-tuned skills. |
| "Sub-agent delegation" | Tool exists but almost never triggers automatically. No documented real-world examples. |
| "GEPA self-evolution, 40% faster" | GEPA is a separate repo, not built into Hermes runtime. Offline developer tool costing $2–10/run. |
| "Self-improving agent" | Saves workflows as markdown notes. Not genuine capability expansion. |

### 6.2 Where each tool wins

| Dimension | Hermes | cam-flow |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Messaging platforms (Slack/Discord) | Strong | Out of scope |
| Persistent memory | Built-in (vector) | Via trace + state |
| Easy setup (one-file install) | Strong | Needs camc + python |
| Multi-machine fleet | Not designed for it | Native (cam contexts) |
| Auto-confirm for Claude Code dialogs | N/A | First-class |
| DAG / loop / wait / resume workflows | Limited | Core |
| NVIDIA-internal integration | None | Via TeaSpirit + AI CLI |
| Structured workflow DSL | No | YAML DSL |
| Self-evolution | GEPA (offline, paid) | Trace-driven (coming Phase 1) |

### 6.3 Conclusion

Complementary, not competing. Hermes is a smart single-agent with
chat-first interfaces. cam-flow is a workflow orchestrator for fleets
of agents doing structured work. Cherry-pick patterns (§2.3, §2.4,
§4.2), don't migrate.

| **Month 2** | §2.5 RTL support (artifact refs, test-hex generation) | Hardware verification workflows become feasible |
| **Month 3+** | §5 items 10–14 | Parallelism, SDK phase, advanced evolution, webhook, Hermes adapter |

---

## 8. Open questions

1. **Agent reuse scope keying.** What identifies "the same loop"? The
   back-edge target node? An explicit `scope:` field in DSL? Needs
   one more pass before implementation.
2. **State schema migration.** When we switch to six-section state,
   existing `state.json` files from CLI phase runs need migration.
   Ship a one-shot converter in `cam-flow migrate`.
3. **Skill evolution ownership.** Evolution reports could live
   alongside state (`.camflow/`) or centrally (`~/.cam/evolve/`).
   Central is easier to aggregate but loses per-project context.
   Likely: per-project writes, central read-side aggregator.
4. **Hermes skill licensing.** Hermes repo is Apache-2.0. Porting is
   clean. Attribution goes into the ported skill file header.
