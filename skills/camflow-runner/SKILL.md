# camflow-runner (CLI mode, single-tick)

Run exactly ONE workflow node, update state, then STOP. The `/loop`
scheduler calls you again for the next node.

You are the CLI-mode executor. You are NOT the workflow controller —
the workflow.yaml is. Your job per tick:

1. Read state
2. Identify the current node
3. Execute it (or invoke the agent to)
4. Capture the result + enrich state
5. Resolve the next transition
6. Write state + trace
7. Exit

Don't loop. Don't execute more than one node. `/loop` handles the
repetition.

## Procedure

### 1. Read state

State path priority (first existing wins; read-through, don't copy):

1. `.camflow/state.json` — primary, co-located with CAM mode
2. `.claude/state/workflow.json` — legacy fallback (pre-0.4)

```bash
# Prefer .camflow/state.json, fall back to .claude/state/workflow.json
if [ -f .camflow/state.json ]; then
  cat .camflow/state.json
elif [ -f .claude/state/workflow.json ]; then
  cat .claude/state/workflow.json
fi
```

- Neither file exists → initialize `{"pc": "start", "status":
  "running", "iteration": 0}` and write it to `.camflow/state.json`
  (the primary path). camflow-manager should have seeded this in
  setup; be defensive.
- When updating an existing state, write back to the SAME path you
  read from — don't migrate mid-flight.
- `status = done`      → reply "Workflow completed." and STOP.
- `status = failed`    → reply "Workflow failed at node <pc>." and
  STOP. Show the last trace entry.
- `status = waiting`   → reply "Workflow waiting for external
  event." and STOP.
- `status = running`   → proceed.

### 2. Read the current node

```bash
# Load workflow and find the node matching state.pc
```

Parse `workflow.yaml`. Find the node whose id equals `state.pc`.

Resolve `{{state.x}}` template variables in the node's `with` and
`do` fields against the current state dict. Do a simple string
substitution — no eval, no complex rendering.

If a `{{state.x}}` reference has no matching state key, leave the
placeholder in place so the error surfaces in the next step rather
than hiding.

### 3. Execute the node

**`cmd <command>`** — run the shell command. Exit 0 → success;
non-zero → fail. Capture stdout (last 2000 chars) and stderr
(last 500 chars).

```bash
bash -c "<resolved command>"
```

**`agent claude`** — the `with` field is YOUR task this tick. You
are the agent. Read files, write code, run commands, whatever is
needed to complete the task described in `with`. Apply any
`methodology` hint if the plan specifies one.

**`subagent claude`** — spawn a subagent via the Agent() tool. Pass
the `with` field as its task prompt. The subagent runs in isolated
context — it has no memory of your conversation. When it returns,
use its result to determine success/fail.

**`skill <name>`** — invoke the named skill via the Skill() tool:
`Skill("<name>")`. Pass the `with` field as context before
invocation.

Determine success/fail:

- `cmd`: exit code (0 = success, non-zero = fail)
- agent / subagent / skill: you decide based on whether the task
  was actually completed

Build a result dict:

```json
{
  "status": "success" | "fail",
  "summary": "<one sentence describing what happened>",
  "state_updates": {
    "...": "key-value pairs to merge into state"
  },
  "error": null | {"code": "...", "message": "..."}
}
```

### 4. Honor `verify` if the node has one

If the node declares a `verify` shell command AND the result is
`status=success`, run the verify cmd:

```bash
bash -c "<verify cmd with state vars resolved>"
```

Non-zero exit → downgrade the result to `status=fail` with
`error.code = "VERIFY_FAIL"` and summary noting the mismatch. This
mirrors the CAM engine's post-agent verify hook — the contract is
the same: agent claimed success, verify overrides.

### 5. Enrich state

Merge the node result into state. Keep it simple (CLI mode doesn't
run the full CAM `enrich_state`, but we capture the essentials):

- Apply `state_updates` via `state.update(result.state_updates)`
- Increment `state.iteration` by 1
- Append to `state.completed[]`:
  `{"node": <pc>, "action": summary, "iteration": ...}` (cap at 20,
  drop oldest)
- If agent reported `new_lesson`, append to `state.lessons[]` (dedup
  by exact string, cap at 10, FIFO prune)
- For `cmd` nodes, store last stdout tail as
  `state.last_cmd_output`; on fail also `state.test_output` so the
  next fix node sees it
- On fail, set `state.blocked = {"node": <pc>, "reason": summary}`
  and append to `state.failed_approaches[]` (cap 5); on success,
  clear `state.blocked`

### 6. Resolve transition (first match wins)

This is the same priority chain the CAM engine uses. First match
wins:

1. Abort control → `status = aborted`, STOP
2. Wait control → `status = waiting`, STOP
3. `transitions: [- if: fail]` and result is fail → goto that target
4. `transitions: [- if: success]` and result is success → goto
5. `transitions: [- if: output.<k>]` truthy → goto
6. `transitions: [- if: state.<k>]` truthy → goto
7. Goto control → goto target
8. Explicit `next` → goto that node
9. Default: on success → `status = done`; on fail → `status = failed`

### 7. Write state and trace

Merge everything into state, then atomically write back to the
SAME path you read from in Step 1 (`.camflow/state.json` preferred;
`.claude/state/workflow.json` only if that was the path you loaded
from):

```python
# Pseudo-python (your actual tool calls will be Bash + Write):
state["pc"] = <next_node_id_or_null>
state["status"] = <new_workflow_status>
# ... and all the enrichment above ...
```

Append to `.claude/state/trace.log` (JSONL, one entry per tick):

```json
{"iteration": <N>, "pc": "<node_id>", "next_pc": "<next|null>",
 "status": "<success|fail>", "summary": "...",
 "reason": "<why this transition fired>",
 "ts": <unix_seconds>}
```

Loop detection: before executing, check trace.log. If the current
node has appeared in `state.failed_approaches` 3+ times, set
`status = failed` and STOP with:

> "Workflow stuck: node `<pc>` failed 3+ times. Stopping for user
> review."

### 8. Report and exit

Print a one-line status for the user:

```
[<node_id>] <success|fail> → <next|done> (<reason>)
```

Then STOP. Do NOT continue to the next node yourself. `/loop` will
call you again after the tick interval.

## Plan-priority fields (if present)

The workflow may carry the same plan-priority fields the CAM engine
honors. In CLI mode we handle them more lightly:

- **`methodology`** — if present, prefix the agent's task with a
  methodology hint from the cam-flow `methodology_router` labels
  (rca / simplify-first / search-first / working-backwards /
  systematic-coverage).
- **`escalation_max`** — track `state.retry_counts[node_id]` and
  cap warning intensity at this level (e.g. if set to 0, never
  emit "try a different approach" banners on retry).
- **`max_retries`** — for a failing node, if
  `state.retry_counts[node_id] >= max_retries`, mark as exhausted
  and fall through to the `if fail` transition instead of retrying.
- **`allowed_tools`** — advisory only in CLI mode; print "this
  node's plan restricts tools to: [...]" and let the user / loop
  driver respect the boundary.
- **`verify`** — honored per Step 4 above.
- **`timeout`** — cmd nodes use this as `timeout <N>s <cmd>`; agent
  tasks are time-bounded by the /loop tick.

## Example trace (calculator demo)

```
iter 1  [start]  success → fix       (next)
iter 2  [fix]    success → test      (next)
iter 3  [test]   fail    → fix       (if fail)
iter 4  [fix]    success → test      (next)
iter 5  [test]   success → done      (if success)
iter 6  [done]   success → null      (workflow done)
```

Six ticks, six `/loop` invocations of camflow-runner. Each one
does ONE node and exits.

---

## Interaction rules

1. **Do exactly ONE node per invocation.** Never process more.
2. **Never silently skip the verify step** if the node declares
   one — that's plan-priority.
3. **Never mutate trace.log retroactively.** Append-only.
4. **Never overwrite state.json without reading first** — partial
   updates lose data.
5. **On loop detection (3+ consecutive fails)**, stop and report to
   the user. Do not keep retrying.
6. **If the workflow is already `done`/`failed`/`waiting`**, STOP
   and report. Do not resurrect.
7. **On `fail` result, set `state.blocked`** so the next fix agent
   sees what broke. On `success`, clear `state.blocked`.

## Relationship to workflow-run

camflow-runner supersedes the older `workflow-run` skill. File
layout and contract are identical (`.claude/state/workflow.json`,
`.claude/state/trace.log`, per-tick single-node execution) but this
version:

- Honors `verify` fields (post-agent gate)
- Handles `methodology` hints
- Caps retries at `max_retries` if the plan declares it
- Maintains the six-section state shape
  (`completed`/`blocked`/`lessons`/`failed_approaches`/...) so a
  workflow can be migrated between CLI and CAM modes without
  losing context

You can still use `workflow-run` for bare-minimum CLI flows that
don't need plan-priority fields. Prefer camflow-runner for anything
new.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not run the CAM engine (that's a separate Python process)
- Does not spawn camc sub-agents (CAM mode only)
- Does not modify workflow.yaml itself
- Does not skip verify checks
- Does not process more than one node per tick
