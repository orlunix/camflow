"""Agent node runner — executes nodes via camc.

Completion is signaled by the result file appearing on disk. We do
NOT trust camc's idle/auto-exit detection (known unreliable, bug #10):
agents do the work but never voluntarily exit. Instead the engine
owns the agent lifecycle:

  1. Clear `.camflow/node-result.json` (stale safety)
  2. Write the full prompt to `.camflow/node-prompt.txt`
     (long multi-line prompts corrupt tmux paste)
  3. `camc run --name camflow-<node> --path <dir>` WITHOUT --auto-exit;
     the prompt arg is a short instruction telling the agent to read
     the prompt file
  4. Send Enter once the TUI is ready (camc pastes but does not submit)
  5. Poll for result file appearance (PRIMARY signal). camc status is
     consulted only as a SECONDARY hint to detect the rare case where
     the agent process actually died.
  6. On result file present OR timeout OR agent gone: explicit
     `camc stop` (graceful) then `camc rm --force` (cleanup). The
     engine kills the agent — never relies on auto-exit.
