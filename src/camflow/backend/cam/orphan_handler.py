"""Orphan agent handling on engine resume.

When the engine crashes mid-node, the agent may still be running in its
tmux session. Naive resume would start a second agent for the same node.

State carries `current_agent_id` whenever an agent is active. On resume we
look at that ID and decide how to handle it.
