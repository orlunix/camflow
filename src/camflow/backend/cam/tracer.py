"""Trace entry builder.

Produces a self-contained dict for one trace.log line. Two shapes:

  ``kind="step"`` — one engine step (the original schema; see fields below)
  ``kind="<event>"`` — agent lifecycle, file ops, control commands, engine
                       /watchdog/lock events, steward handoff. Schema lives
                       in ``docs/design-next-phase.md`` §13.

Step-entry schema (see docs/cam-phase-plan.md §7.1 + docs/evaluation.md §2):
  kind, step, ts_start, ts_end, duration_ms, node_id, do, attempt, is_retry,
  retry_mode, input_state, node_result, output_state, transition,
  agent_id, exec_mode, completion_signal, lesson_added, event,
  # evaluation fields (see docs/evaluation.md):
  prompt_tokens, context_tokens, task_tokens,
  tools_available, tools_used, context_position,
  enricher_enabled, fenced, methodology, escalation_level

Event-entry schema (any non-step kind):
  kind, ts, actor, flow_id, plus kind-specific fields.

Readers MUST default missing ``kind`` to ``"step"`` for backward compat
with traces written before this field existed.

Relationship to ``camflow.steward.events.EVENT_TYPES``
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two CLOSED sets exist in this codebase, with deliberately different
audiences:

  ``tracer.EVENT_KINDS``         — values of the ``kind`` field in
                                   ``trace.log``. Audit / timeline channel.

  ``steward.events.EVENT_TYPES`` — values the engine pushes to the
                                   Steward via ``camc send`` as
                                   ``[CAMFLOW EVENT] {"type": "...", ...}``.
                                   Push channel.

When the engine pushes a Steward event, the trace records the push
attempt as ``kind="event_emitted"`` with the Steward type carried in
the ``event_type`` field — NOT as its own kind. So a Steward
``node_done`` event lands in trace as
``{"kind": "event_emitted", "event_type": "node_done", ...}``, not as
``{"kind": "node_done", ...}``.

A few names appear in both sets on purpose: ``flow_started`` /
``flow_terminal`` / ``flow_idle`` are project-level state transitions
that warrant a direct audit entry in addition to the Steward push.
The current implementation only wires the Steward push for these;
direct project-level emission lands in Phase B as the audit trail
tightens (see ``docs/triage-2026-04-26.md`` §5.2).
``compaction_detected`` and ``handoff_completed`` live in this set
(tracer only) — they are written when the engine archives an old
Steward, never pushed to a Steward.

Drift between the two sets is caught by ``tests/unit/test_event_sets.py``.
