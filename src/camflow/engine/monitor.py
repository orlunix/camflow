"""Engine self-monitoring: heartbeat thread, stale detection, lock file.

camflow is a USER of camc — the engine manages its own lifecycle. This
module provides three primitives Engine.run() composes:

    HeartbeatThread  — daemon that periodically stamps .camflow/heartbeat.json
    EngineLock       — fcntl-based single-writer guard on .camflow/engine.lock
    is_stale / is_process_alive / load_heartbeat — recovery-time checks

Layout of .camflow/heartbeat.json::

    {
        "pid": 12345,
        "timestamp": "2026-04-21T12:00:00Z",
        "pc": "eval_swerv",
        "iteration": 3,
        "agent_id": "5130c656",
        "uptime_seconds": 1234
    }

A heartbeat is "stale" when (now - timestamp) exceeds a threshold; a
stale heartbeat on a non-existent PID means the previous engine died.

      its pid is dead, or it's at least ``heartbeat_threshold`` seconds
