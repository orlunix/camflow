"""Agent never produces a result file → engine times out and records a typed failure.

With --auto-exit removed, the engine owns the agent lifecycle; the only
ways a wait can end without a result are TIMEOUT (agent still running but
hasn't written the file) and AGENT_GONE (process died). This test simulates
the timeout path.
